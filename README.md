# iOS App Store Clone (UIKit)

A fun rebuild of the native iOS (13) App Store, which is beautifully designed and a ton of fun to implement with `UICollectionView` and friends. No better way to have greater of appreciation of something than trying to recreate it. ðŸ¤“

The app uses a blend of the [iTunes Search API](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/AudioVideo/Conceptual/iTuneSearchAPI/Searching.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40017632-CH5-SW1) and some mock data (from `data/feed.json`) for more of the editorial / curated componeents. Check out the `Services/Network.swift` file to learn more about how those calls are assembled.

This is still a work-in-progress, purely for learning purposes!
